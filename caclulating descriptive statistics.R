#To calculate the mean, median and std deviation for the numeric and categorical variable
#we can also calculate the centre and spead of the variable

mean(Age, trim = 0.10)            #this will remove the bottom 10% and top 10% observation from the operation

median(Age)                       #calculate median

sd(Age)                           #calculate st deviation
